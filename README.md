# ShopPal

## What it does:
ShopPal is an IOS app that allows users to take a picture of their receipts and save them in the app. Users can then view, sort and organize their receipts at any time.

## How we built it: 
We built our app using a combination of technologies. For the mobile part, we used XCode and the development languages SwiftUI and Swift. On the backend, we utilized Node.js and the Express framework. To handle the database and storage of images, we utilized Amazon Web Services (AWS). The Node.js server was also hosted on AWS. This combination of technologies allowed us to create a seamless and robust app that delivers a great user experience.

## Challenges we ran into: 
One of the biggest challenges we faced was building the backend server using Node.js and Express. We had to ensure that all user actions were facilitated, including login, signup, uploading a receipt, retrieving multiple receipts, etc. We also faced challenges while integrating and utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS), including EC2, S3 and DynamoDB, to store data and images and host the server.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of: 
We are proud of our ability to effectively utilize a combination of technologies to build our app. We were able to effectively use XCode, SwiftUI, Swift, Node.js, and Express to create a mobile app with a seamless and robust user experience. Additionally, we are proud of our ability to effectively use AWS to handle the database, store images, and host the Node.js server, which allowed us to scale our app and keep it running smoothly.

## What's next: 
We are planning to add more features to the app, such as the ability to categorize receipts, set reminders for returns, and integrate with other apps such as budgeting apps. We also plan to make the app available for android as well.
